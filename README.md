# Gridiron Stats --- NFL Crimes Application <br> [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samirdhebar/Gridiron_Stats/master/LICENSE.md)
An application created by [Samir Dhebar](https://github.com/samirdhebar) and [Justin Loffredo](https://github.com/justloffredo). A front-end application that illustrates crime information between teams in the National Football League.

## Getting Started

You must be on a Node version greater than 6 to use this. Once you've npm
installed, there are only two commands:

* `npm run start` - Runs the development server (Specify port with PORT, default 3000)
* `npm run build` - Builds the production version, which goes into `dist`/

#Deployment
* http://gridironstatistics.herokuapp.com

Once you start building things with this template, you may want to remove the
`.placeholder` files in `src/assets/fonts`, `src/assets/images`, and
`src/components` folders. They were added just to check in those directories.

## Deployment

* http://gridironstatistics.herokuapp.com

## React / Webpack Template

This template allows you to very quickly spin up a React application that's
equipped with Webpack for builds. It provides the following features:

* ES2017 and JSX using Babel
* Style components using SASS
* Asset resolving via file loader for JS and CSS
* Image compression using image-webpack-loader
* Hot module replacement with Webpack Dev Server
* Source maps in development and production
* A standard minified production build
